### What I learned
During the development of this landing page template, I gained experience in using HTML and CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing web page. I also learned how to integrate third-party libraries, such as Font Awesome and Google Fonts, into a web project. Additionally, I practiced organizing files and directories in a structured manner for a web project.
